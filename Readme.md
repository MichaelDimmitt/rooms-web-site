## lost the notebook that had the wireframes. ðŸ˜¢

Anyway, here is the basic gist.

This project was all about different ways to display information<br/>
(break away from a list based lifestyle.<br/>
of course, all of the data still exists in a list that gets translated into these experiences.

It started by thinking about that scene from [jurassic park](https://youtu.be/dxIPcbmo1_U)

1) Adding links and hovers to images.
2) Additionally grow animations or glow to highlight at clickable areas.
3) Challenge: how to get the image to scale across all screens. (prereq, super high resolution image.)
4) Rooms: 
  Kitchen (expiration dates)
  Garage (garage-organization, hardware-projects)
  Outside (play, entertainment)
  Bathroom (accountability-mirror, shave-routine-"configurable")
  Bedroom (rest-routine, wash laundry, wash sheets, personal-contacts)
  Maproom (location related knowledge, reviews, bike paths)
  Work (competency resume, impact resume, side-projects, work-contacts)
5) Challenge: how to get people to quickly add items to their garage toolbox.
6) 

Additonal discoveries:
LATCH, an acronym that most inforamtion can be sorted by:
